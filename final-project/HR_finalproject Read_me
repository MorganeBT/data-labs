Context
HR data can be hard to come by, and HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data visualization competency. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano and I set out to create our own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of our graduate MSHRM courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of Business. We created this data set ourselves. We use the data set to teach HR students how to use and analyze the data in Tableau Desktop - a data visualization tool that's easy to learn.

Content
We have reduced the complexity of the dataset down to a single data file (v13). The CSV revolves around a fictitious company, called Dental Magic, and the core data set contains names, DOBs, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, department, whether they are active or terminated, position title, pay rate, manager name, and performance score.

Recent additions to the data include: - Absences - Most Recent Performance Review Date - Employee Engagement Score

Acknowledgements
Dr. Carla Patalano provided the baseline idea for creating this synthetic data set, which has been used now by over 100 Human Resource Management students at the college. Students in the course learn data visualization techniques with Tableau Desktop and use this data set to complete a series of assignments.

Inspiration
We've included some open-ended questions that you can explore and try to address through creating R or Python analyses. Good luck and enjoy the learning!

Is there any relationship between who a person works for and their performance score?
What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?
Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?
There are so many other interesting questions that could be addressed through this interesting data set. Dr. Patalano and I look forward to seeing what we can come up with.

The HR Dataset was designed by Drs. Rich Huebner and Carla Patalano to accompany a case study designed for graduate HR students studying HR metrics, measurement, and analytics. The students use Tableau data visualization software to uncover insights about the case. This is a synthetic data set created specifically to go along with the case study (proprietary for the college that we teach at).

Every year or so, we update the data set to include additional columns, and to make slight changes to the underlying data. In this version, we add several new features to the data set:

Engagement Survey Results, a floating-point number, range between 1 and 5.
Special Project Count, integer, which is the number of special projects the employee worked on in the last year.
Last Performance Review Date, date, to ensure that all employees are receiving timely reviews.
Days Late in the Last 30 days, integer, as an attendance metric.

Any derived fields such as AGE and DaysEmployed have been removed.

##### Human Resources

This is another relational data set where you can practice your SQL joins as well as data wrangling, analysis, and machine learning. As far as applying machine learning to this data set, you can attempt to cluster employees together into similar groups, you can attempt to predict performance scores or pay rate, or you can attempt to predict whether an employee will be terminated within a certain amount of time. Additionally, you can also analyze the relationship between pay and performance by position, department, and manager as well as employee demographics.

Once you have chosen a data set, you will need to download it. In order to do so, you will need to create a free Kaggle account if you don't already have one. Once you have downloaded the data, you should perform the steps below:

* Create a new MySQL database where your data will eventually be stored.
* Create a new Jupyter Notebook for your project.
* In the Jupyter Notebook, read the data files using Python.
* Perform any necessary data wrangling and cleaning using Python.
* Create a connection to your MySQL database using `pymysql` and `sqlalchemy` and write the clean version of the data to the database.
