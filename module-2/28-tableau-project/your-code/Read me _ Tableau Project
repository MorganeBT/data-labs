Dear Visitor,
Let me share you my Tableau project through this link:

https://public.tableau.com/profile/morgane.berilhe.tuy#!/vizhome/ProjectTableau_15702913572580/Story1?publish=yes

By learning about Survival analysis in the module 2 of the data analysis courses, I worked on a dataset gathering HR data to calculate and plot retention rate and attrition.
I discovered that some series were about the rate of satisfaction (environment, relationaship, job involvment, ...) and decided to explore this dataset in my Tableau project in order to visualize some insights (we actually do not really look at it in the HR department where I am working.)

Objectives: 
- discovering how HR data can be viewed to explore the employees information 
- correlating some series which could be worked on to improve the internal HR policy
- pointing out how the HR department is viewed in this present company, which can be the main source of improvement

Hope you enjoy these insights!

Do not hesitate to challenge my project. Every day is a learning day! :-)
